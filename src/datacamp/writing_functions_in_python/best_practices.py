Crafting a docstring
You've decided to write the world's greatest open-source natural language processing Python package. It will revolutionize working with free-form text, the way numpy did for arrays, pandas did for tabular data, and scikit-learn did for machine learning.
The first function you write is count_letter(). It takes a string and a single letter and returns the number of times the letter appears in the string. You want the users of your open-source package to be able to understand how this function works easily, so you will need to give it a docstring. Build up a Google Style docstring for this function by following these steps.

1)
Copy the following string and add it as the docstring for the function:
   Count the number of times `letter` appears in `content`.
"""
# Add a docstring to count_letter()
def count_letter(content, letter):
  """Count the number of times `letter` appears in `content`.
  """

  if (not isinstance(letter, str)) or len(letter) != 1:
    raise ValueError('`letter` must be a single character string.')
  return len([char for char in content if char == letter])

"""
2)
Now add the arguments section, using the Google style for docstrings. Use str to indicate a string.
"""
def count_letter(content, letter):
  """Count the number of times `letter` appears in `content`.

  Args:
    content (str): The string to search.
    letter (str): The letter to search for.
  """
  if (not isinstance(letter, str)) or len(letter) != 1:
    raise ValueError('`letter` must be a single character string.')
  return len([char for char in content if char == letter])

"""
3)
Add a returns section that informs the user the return value is an int.
"""
def count_letter(content, letter):
  """Count the number of times `letter` appears in `content`.

  Args:
    content (str): The string to search.
    letter (str): The letter to search for.

  Returns:
    int
  """
  if (not isinstance(letter, str)) or len(letter) != 1:
    raise ValueError('"letter" must be a single character string.')
  return len([char for char in content if char == letter])

"""
4)
Finally, add some information about the ValueError that gets raised when the arguments aren't correct.
"""
def count_letter(content, letter):
  """Count the number of times `letter` appears in `content`.

  Args:
    content (str): The string to search.
    letter (str): The letter to search for.

  Returns:
    int

  Raises:
    ValueError: If `letter` is not a one-character string.
  """
  if (not isinstance(letter, str)) or len(letter) != 1:
    raise ValueError('`letter` must be a single character string.')
  return len([char for char in content if char == letter])

Retrieving docstrings
You and a group of friends are working on building an amazing new Python IDE (integrated development environment -- like PyCharm, Spyder, Eclipse, Visual Studio, etc.). The team wants to add a feature that displays a tooltip with a function's docstring whenever the user starts typing the function name. That way, the user doesn't have to go elsewhere to look up the documentation for the function they are trying to use. You've been asked to complete the build_tooltip() function that retrieves a docstring from an arbitrary function.

You will be reusing the count_letter() function that you developed in the last exercise to show that we can properly extract its docstring.

1)
Begin by getting the docstring for the function count_letter(). Use an attribute of the count_letter() function.
'''
# Get the "count_letter" docstring by using an attribute of the function
docstring = count_letter.__doc__

border = '#' * 28
print('{}\n{}\n{}'.format(border, docstring, border))

'''
2)
Now use a function from the inspect module to get a better-formatted version of count_letter()'s docstring.
'''
import inspect

# Inspect the count_letter() function to get its docstring
docstring = inspect.getdoc(count_letter)

border = '#' * 28
print('{}\n{}\n{}'.format(border, docstring, border))

'''
3)
Now create a build_tooltip() function that can extract the docstring from any function that we pass to it.
'''

import inspect

def build_tooltip(function):
  """Create a tooltip for any function that shows the
  function's docstring.

  Args:
    function (callable): The function we want a tooltip for.

  Returns:
    str
  """
  # Get the docstring for the "function" argument by using inspect
  docstring = inspect.getdoc(function)
  border = '#' * 28
  return '{}\n{}\n{}'.format(border, docstring, border)

print(build_tooltip(count_letter))
print(build_tooltip(range))
print(build_tooltip(print))

Docstrings to the rescue!
Some maniac has corrupted your installation of numpy! All of the functions still exist, but they've been given random names. You desperately need to call the numpy.histogram() function and you don't have time to reinstall the package. Fortunately for you, the maniac didn't think to alter the docstrings, and you know how to access them. numpy has a lot of functions in it, so we've narrowed it down to four possible functions that could be numpy.histogram() in disguise: numpy.leyud(), numpy.uqka(), numpy.fywdkxa() or numpy.jinzyxq().

Examine each of these functions' docstrings in the IPython shell to determine which of them is actually numpy.histogram().

Answers
numpy.fywdkxa()

Extract a function
While you were developing a model to predict the likelihood of a student graduating from college, you wrote this bit of code to get the z-scores of students' yearly GPAs. Now you're ready to turn it into a production-quality system, so you need to do something about the repetition. Writing a function to calculate the z-scores would improve this code.

# Standardize the GPAs for each year
df['y1_z'] = (df.y1_gpa - df.y1_gpa.mean()) / df.y1_gpa.std()
df['y2_z'] = (df.y2_gpa - df.y2_gpa.mean()) / df.y2_gpa.std()
df['y3_z'] = (df.y3_gpa - df.y3_gpa.mean()) / df.y3_gpa.std()
df['y4_z'] = (df.y4_gpa - df.y4_gpa.mean()) / df.y4_gpa.std()
Note: df is a pandas DataFrame where each row is a student with 4 columns of yearly student GPAs: y1_gpa, y2_gpa, y3_gpa, y4_gpa

Instructions:
Finish the function so that it returns the z-scores of a column.
Use the function to calculate the z-scores for each year (df['y1_z'], df['y2_z'], etc.) from the raw GPA scores (df.y1_gpa, df.y2_gpa, etc.).
'''

def standardize(column):
  """Standardize the values in a column.

  Args:
    column (pandas Series): The data to standardize.

  Returns:
    pandas Series: the values as z-scores
  """
  # Finish the function so that it returns the z-scores
  z_score = (column - column.mean()) / column.std()
  return z_score

# Use the standardize() function to calculate the z-scores

df['y1_z'] = standardize(df.y1_gpa)
df['y2_z'] = standardize(df.y2_gpa)
df['y3_z'] = standardize(df.y3_gpa)
df['y4_z'] = standardize(df.y4_gpa)

'''
Split up a function
Another engineer on your team has written this function to calculate the mean and median of a sorted list. You want to show them how to split it into two simpler functions: mean() and median()

def mean_and_median(values):
  """Get the mean and median of a sorted list of `values`

  Args:
    values (iterable of float): A list of numbers

  midpoint = int(len(values) / 2)
  if len(values) % 2 == 0:
    median = (values[midpoint - 1] + values[midpoint]) / 2
  else:
    median = values[midpoint]

  return mean, median

1)
Write the mean() function.

2)
Write the median() function.

def median(values):
  """Get the median of a sorted list of values

  Args:

  else:
    median = values[midpoint]
  return median

Mutable or immutable?
The following function adds a mapping between a string and the lowercase version of that string to a dictionary. What do you expect the values of d and s to be after the function is called?

def store_lower(_dict, _string):
  """Add a mapping between `_string` and a lowercased version of `_string` to `_dict`

  Args:
    _dict (dict): The dictionary to update.
    _string (str): The string to add.

  orig_string = _string
  _string = _string.lower()
  _dict[orig_string] = _string

d = {}
s = 'Hello'

store_lower(d, s)


Answer:
d = {'Hello': 'hello'}, s = 'Hello'

Best practice for default arguments
One of your co-workers (who obviously didn't take this course) has written this function for adding a column to a pandas DataFrame. Unfortunately, they used a mutable variable as a default argument value! Please show them a better way to do this so that they don't get unexpected behavior.

def add_column(values, df=pandas.DataFrame()):
  """Add a column of `values` to a DataFrame `df`.
  The column will be named "col_<n>" where "n" is
  the numerical index of the column.

      If no DataFrame is passed, one is created by default.

  """
  df['col_{}'.format(len(df.columns))] = values
  return df
